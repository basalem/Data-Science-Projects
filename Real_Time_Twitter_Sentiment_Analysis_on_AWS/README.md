## Note:
Thank you for visiting my Github repository, the following project is currently under progress and I will keep updating with project structure and workflow soon!

# Approach: 

- Real-time data ingestion using Kafka or Kinesis Firehose
- Big Data Exploration using Hive and Presto
- Training Machine Learning models at scale using Spark MLlib
- Deploy Spark streaming applications for real-time scoring of twitter sentiments
- Real-time monitoring using Elastic and Kibana

I will implement the following for the purpose of trying different ML model deployment approaches 

- Machine Learning model deployment in docker containers
- Scaling model training to Amazon SageMaker
- Model deployment and serving Amazon SageMaker
