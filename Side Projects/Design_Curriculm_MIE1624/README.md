## Design a Course Curriculm for MIE1624 at University of Toronto
I would like to apologize for not posting the notebooks for the following project. It was a team project of 4 members and out of respect for team effort I did not share it, however, I am open to share it with you during an interview. Here is a brief description of project and what we have done: 

1. We were asked to develop ML model as a tool to help in designing a course curriculum for Introduction to Data Science & Analytics. 
2. To obtain data, we web scraped indeed job posting for data science soft and technical skills; in addition to business analysis skills. 2018 Kaggle ML & DS Survey was also used as data source to further support our web scrapped data. 
3. Beautiful soap, data cleaning, text analysis (NLTK, regular expression) and data cleaning were used to fully organize data. 
4. We cluster job postings into data science and business analytics using K-means dendrogram and hierarchical clustering to give better visualization for certain skills related to each job category. 
5. We developed consulting proposal report to propose a data science education startup.
