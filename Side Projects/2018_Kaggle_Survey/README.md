## 2018 Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey Challenge
The survey dataset gives information about machine learning and data science best practices at different industries. We can extract a lot of meaningful information to help new data scientists to break into field by knowing most common skills and practices used by Kaggle community. 
The data given is messy and contains a combination of numerical and categorical features. A lot of data cleaning and EDA was performed to prepare data for machine learning implementation. Please feel free to look at notebook!
